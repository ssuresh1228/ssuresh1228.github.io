	<h1>CSC-196w Assignment 2a</h1>
    <p>My name is Sai Suresh, and I'm really interested in GPUs and PC hardware in general, as well as <strong> building and modifying </strong> mechanical keyboards.</p>
	
	<p>The image below is the NovelKeys NK65, which was my first custom keyboard. In this build, I used Minterly's <a href="https://cannonkeys.com/products/seal-linear-switch-by-minterly">Alpaca switches</a> which are linear switches with a fairly heavy 78 gram spring weight.
	   For keycaps, I went with the <a href="https://en.akkogear.com/product/neon-full-keycap-set-157-key/">Akko Neons</a> in the ASA profile which I chose because this profile is essentially a shorter SA profile.
	   
	   For modding, I used Tempest's tape mod which is just applying a couple layers of painter's tape on the back of the PCB, and added switch films to all of the switches while lubing them (takes a really long time to do). I also used a fake gasket mount (burger mount) for the plate which basically consists of mounting all the hardware on small gaskets.
